# Prediction System for Mortality and Recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a symptomatic infection due to the toxin-producing bacterium Clostridioides difficile. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, abdominal pain and severe colon inflammation that can even be fatal. We developed a Machine Learning model here to provide a fast and accurate assessment of patients' mortality and recurrence rates.
